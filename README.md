## Tutorial/Examples

This is just a project for learning various languages and their syntax and tools, over the years I have seen various questions about these things on Stack Overflow and Reddit and I thought I'd try my hand at generating a bunch of examples.

### Code examples for taking user input from console and displaying it back

**Featured language examples:**
```
  Ada               Assembler x64
  Bash              Basic-256/Qbasic

  Nim               GNU Fortran
```

### Code examples for random number generation

### Code examples for FizzBuzz problem

**Featured language examples:**
```
Python 3            Ruby
PHP                 Rust
```

### Install guide Kali Linux
```
Note: these installation packages will most likely work in Debian and Ubuntu aswell.

If you use Kali full install:
$ sudo apt install kali-linux-large

In that case: nasm, go, gcc, js, java, python3, perl, PHP and ruby might be pre-installed.
Otherwise find these packages.

These might need to be installed:
Install Ada: $ sudo apt install gnat-10
Install Haskell: $ sudo apt install ghc
Install Common Lisp: $ sudo apt install clisp
Install Lua: $ sudo apt install lua5.4
Install Scala: $ sudo apt install scala
Install Smalltalk: $ sudo apt install gnu-smalltalk
Install Rust: $ sudo apt install rustc
Install Basic256: $ sudo apt install basic256
Install Nim: $ sudo apt install nim
Install Go: $ sudo apt install golang
Install Fortran: $ sudo apt install gfortran

For the rust rand program to compile/work you might need:
$ sudo apt install librust-rand-dev libssl-dev
$ cargo install cargo-edit

Add /home/<youruser>/.cargo.bin to path:
$ nano /home/<youruser>/.bashrc

ADD this line to the end of the file:
export PATH="/home/<youruser>/.cargo/bin:$PATH"

Start PowerShell by typing: $ pwsh

```
### Interactive shells
C#, like Python offers an interactive shell. You start it by typing `csharp` in your console, just like `idle` or `python3`

Feel free to comment or add suggestions for more languages.
